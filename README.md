# Picker Extended!  Now with pipette extension
Extended version of the picker mod by Tinyboss

### Picker ghost revivier
Hover over a ghost and use the Factorio pipette tool to pick the entity that places it. Press the pipette tool button again to revive the ghost. Reviving a ghost keeps all of its settings and module requests. Picker extended will also try and fill module slots of revived ghosts if they have requests.
Recomend using this with the same keybinds as clean cursor and pipette tool. Picker extend can also pick up selected items on the ground and put it in your hands.

### Picker Crafter
Alt-Q on an entity and picker will try to craft that entity if you have the items in your inventory. Can be bound to Q for even quicker crafting access.

### Picker Dollies
Hover over entities and use the Picker dolly keybinds to move entities around. Entities will keep their wire connections and settings. This allows you to build your set up spaced out and when you are finished push it all together for a nice tight build. Some entities can't be shoved around. Also respect max wire distance. Data Raw Prototypes mod is needed to Move entities, Combinators can be moved without it.  Note Moving some modded entities that rely on position can cause issues.

### Picker Entity Blueprinter
Hover over an entity and take a quick blueprint of everything in its selection area with CTRL + R. Blueprints are created automatically if you don't have an existing Pipette Blueprint in your inventory. Modules and recipes are stored in the blueprint. Now you can quickly blueprint your moduled beacon for fast placing! Using this keybind with nothing in your hand and nothing selected will put a blank blueprint in your hand for quick blueprinting an area. If you have a blueprint in your hand it will switch to the deconstruction planner if you have nothing selected.

### Picker Zapper
Have an inventory full of pesky blueprints? Try dropping them on the ground by using the drop item keybind (default z) and they will be zapped away into the nether.

### Picker Chest Copy
Quickly copy the contents of once chest to another. This is a quick and simple copy. CTRL-V on the source chest and CTRL-V on the destination chest. This will not transfer item grids.

### Picker Quick Repair
Hover over any damanged entity and press CTRL - Q with nothing in your hands to grab a repair tool from your inventory.

### Picker Module Reviver
Hover over any item request proxy and press Q to search your inventory for the requested modules/items and insert them.

### Picker Belt Brush (soon)

### Picker Automatic Orphan Finder

### Picker Wire Tools (SOON)
